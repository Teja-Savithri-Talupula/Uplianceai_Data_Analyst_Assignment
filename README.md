# Uplianceai_Data_Analyst_Assignment
Project Overview:
--> This project focuses on analyzing user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends using three datasets
      UserDetails, 
      CookingSessions, 
      OrderDetails. 
--> The primary objective is to clean, merge, and analyze the data to uncover insights into user demographics, popular dishes, and the relationship between cooking sessions and orders.  
--> The analysis involves identifying trends, such as popular meal times and frequently ordered dishes, while exploring demographic factors influencing user choices.
--> Visualizations, including charts highlight key patterns and support business recommendations for improving customer engagement, and marketing strategies.  

The final deliverable includes a detailed report summarizing findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

Tools Used:
Excel: For data cleaning, merging, and organizing datasets.
Pivot Tables: For summarizing data trends and insights.

Steps:
1.Data Preparation :
  * Download the Dataset : Ensuring the datasets are available in your working directory.
2.Clean the Data:
  * By using Excel: Remove the duplicates using the Data -> Remove Duplicates feature.
  * Handle missing values using IFERROR or manual replacement.
3.Merge the Dataset:
  * By using VLOOKUP formula to link data based on USER ID
  * Merge tables by matching keys across datasets.
4.Analysis:

      - Count of users by age group and location.
      - Average total orders by location.
      - Rank dishes by users
      - Use Countifs for dish popularity.
5.Visualization:
   - Create Bar charts for user demographics.

    - Highlights trends and patterns discovered during the analysis.
    - Include visualizations and keys insights in the report.
  * Provide Recommendations:
    - suggest data-driven strategies, such as targeted marketing
